<p><strong>Author: Katie Li</strong></p>
<p>On July 19th, five successful founders of the NPO Core community highlighted their experiences growing a nonprofit from the ground up—Chinmayi Balusu of Simply Neuroscience, Shrey Gupta of Irvine Lights, Gabby Banaag of Helloo World, Arun Mommileti of United2Care, and Shivali Gulati of Girl Genius. In NPO Core’s online webinar, these founders shared their tips and insights on how to transform any idea into reality.</p>
<p><strong>Coming up with a mission</strong></p>
<p>An organization’s mission statement guides the entire initiative and its activities, so it’s crucial to put the time and energy into crafting a specific mission that serves as a strong framework, while also allowing for flexibility down the line. If a mission is too broad, your NPO may struggle to enact any sort of substantive change. Narrowing it down to a very specific purpose, such as United2Care’s mission of spreading hand sanitization awareness to rural communities, can help your nonprofit create relevant, achievable goals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to do research beforehand and make sure that your mission is unique. If multiple other organizations are trying to achieve the same thing in the same way, then creating your nonprofit might actually do more harm than good. The purpose of a nonprofit is to create positive change, and that’s difficult to do when multiple organizations are fighting for the same resources. To gather inspiration and make sure that your idea is original, NPO Core’s website provides a list of nonprofits with their missions.</p>
<p><strong>Forming an effective team</strong></p>
<p>There are many different ways you can go about forming a team, but the best way depends on individual circumstances. For example, some nonprofit founders build their initial team by recruiting trusted friends while others find and connect with prospective team members online. At the end of the day, you should build your NPO team on two core principles—a shared vision and team dynamic.</p>
<p>Moreover, it’s critical to have a variety of different skill sets when building your team. While an experienced candidate may be the most qualified, they aren’t always the best choice. A few of these founders even displayed a preference towards applicants with less experience if they demonstrated enough passion and a desire to learn. The most important thing to remember, though, is to give your team creative control. Welcoming new ideas will not only make your team members happier, but will also allow your NPO to make the strongest impact possible.</p>
<p><strong>Making an impact</strong></p>
<p>Shivali Gulati, founder of Girl Genius, often gets the question of how she can increase her impact. The response always goes: “Why do you want to increase your impact?”</p>
<p>The answer might seem straightforward at first; after all, who doesn’t want to make an impact? But the truth is, impacting people goes hand in hand with genuine interest and dedication to the cause. During the webinar, Shivali said, “When I was in elementary school, I used to come home every day and finish my homework as fast as I could, and then I would play Mario Kart for the rest of the day. That’s the way you should treat running your nonprofit. You should play because you want to.” The easiest way to drive change is to make sure that you’re enjoying the work that goes into your nonprofit.</p>
<p>Another strategy to maximize your NPO’s impact is focusing on one project at a time, especially when you’re just getting started. Attempting to ration your focus between multiple different projects at once will limit the efficacy of all of them. Instead, give 100% of your efforts to one project before moving on to the next, bringing valuable skills and lessons you learned along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Building an online presence</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant aspects to gaining traction is making sure your NPO has a strong social media presence. From interactive content to a brand aesthetic, the content you post must be both relevant and engaging.</p>
<p>On another note, social media acts as a channel to contact other organizations for partnerships, shoutouts, or simply to network. There are numerous benefits to working with other NPOs, and you can start today by heading over to NPO Core and registering your nonprofit.</p>
<p><strong>Raising money</strong></p>
<p>Once your nonprofit grows enough, it becomes impossible to host large events or increase your impact without funding. NPOs tend to have the most success finding sponsorships when they cold email larger companies who may be willing to exchange money or products for increased publicity. Cold emails typically do best when they’re sent at 8:00am on Mondays.</p>
<p>When writing a cold email, remember to keep it short and sweet; nobody has time to read an essay filled with irrelevant information. That being said, there are still important elements that must be included: your nonprofit’s mission, the impact you’ve had, previous sponsorships and partnerships, and how your NPO can benefit the sponsors. Including details such as the number of people who’ve visited your website or attended certain events is a great way to scale your impact and establish legitimacy with sponsors.</p>
<p><strong>Registering as a 501(c)(3)</strong></p>
<p>Before launching yourself into the world of endless laws and paperwork, ask yourself whether it’s even necessary to register as a 501(c)(3). Obtaining a fiscal sponsorship is a great alternative in which a 501(c)(3) extends its tax-exempt status to your NPO and takes a small percentage of the funds you raise.</p>
<p>At first, this might sound far from ideal, but it’s oftentimes cheaper than paying all of the fees associated with registering as a 501(c)(3) yourself. However, once you begin raising large sums of money you can consider registering your own NPO. In this case, the internet and the NPO Core community are your best friends; while you may want to pay for a lawyer or agent, the general consensus is that these services aren’t worth the exorbitant costs.</p>
<p>To learn more about successful NPOs, see examples of effective mission statements, or find partners and opportunities, NPO Core is the perfect one-stop-shop. The panelists in the webinar have all registered their nonprofits on NPO Core, so if you have any questions or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to them there!</p>
